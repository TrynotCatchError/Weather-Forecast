        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
          This React Weather App allows users to get real-time weather information for any city around the world.
          Built with a focus on API integration and user interaction, the app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API to provide 
          current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions based on user input.
