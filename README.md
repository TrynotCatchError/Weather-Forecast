# Project: React Weather App

This React Weather App allows users to get real-time weather information for any city around the world. Built with a focus on API integration and user interaction, the app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API to provide current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions based on user input. **Built with React.js, OpenWeatherMap API**

### âš¡ Key Features
